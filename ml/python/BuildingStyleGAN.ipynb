    "We could state this more explicitly as:\n",

    "$$ Z, W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{512} $$\n",

    "### Multilayer Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "But what, exactly, is a \"multilayer perceptron\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "An MLP is a very simple kind of neural network that simply takes a vector input, multiplies it with a weight matrix to get another vector, and then repeats for some number of layers. Formally:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times m} $$\n",
    "$$ w \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n} $$\n",
    "$$ y = \\sigma(x \\cdot w) $$\n",
    "$$ y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times n} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is essentially just a vector, matrix product with the addition of a nonlinear activation function ($\\sigma$). Notably, if the weight matrix $w$ is square, $x$ and $y$ will be the same dimension, and this is what is happening in the Mapping Network."
